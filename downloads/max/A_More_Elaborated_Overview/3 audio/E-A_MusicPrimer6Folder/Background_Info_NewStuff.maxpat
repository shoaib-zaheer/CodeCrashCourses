Not only does it work well for my in-class demos, but my students can immediately explore these demos on their own, since they no longer need several hours of hands-on instruction learning their way around an old analog studio just to figure out how to reproduce the basic demos I'd presented in class on an old Moog synthesizer.  Graphic and visual feedback (on-screen oscilloscopes, sliders, graphic envelopes) combine with audio output to make the concepts and principles easy to comprehend."

When the scope died, I carried on with the just the Moog. When the Moog died, I carried on using a Kurzweil K2000. With each change, however, the demos lost a little of their immediacy and pedagogical clarity. "

Much of the initial work was accomplished by passing small files back and forth via email during a holiday break from our regular school schedules -- a very cool way to collaborate!"

I think this reinforces (eventually) what is actually going on and helps to dispel suspicions of digital \"hocus-pocus.\" It also helps serve as an introduction to learning Max/MSP programming, which they may delve into later in the curriculum at my school"
