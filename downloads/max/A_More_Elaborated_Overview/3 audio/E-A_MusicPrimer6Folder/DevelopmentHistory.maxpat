In addition, all the modules got a face-lift, which substantially updated the user interface;\n\n2004\rported application to OS X and to cross-platform version of Max/MSP\n\n2002-03\rSeveral new modules were added to the ProjectSynth Pack. Additional oscillators were added to modules for additive and FM synthesis, as well as new modules with descriptive names such as SoundSculptor, ModWheelMayhem, StepSequencer, and Pierre'sPlayhouse (a cute little digital musique concr√®te workshop that specializes in simple real-time pitch shifting and looping). In addition, I \"tweaked\" nearly all the older modules and completely overhauled a few. Most notably you will find several more oscilloscopes added to modules, a few more explanitory notes, some presets, and in general, a little more standardization of design. I also added MIDI input and sound file record/playback to all of the modules in the Filters&LFO_Modulation heading, to make them viable for use in student projects.\n\n2001\rThe original version of ProjectSynthPack was added. Also added were MIDI input and \"record\" features to some of the demos that were capable of more elaborate audio output. Students began using the software to create. mini-compositions or (more likely) raw source audio files to import into another digital audio program;\n\r2000;\rOriginal version of most \"Audio Basics\" demo modules."
